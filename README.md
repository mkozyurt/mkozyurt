Hi, I’m Kadri Ozyurt. I am currently using Git Hub to maintain database scripts under version control.
I’m interested in ways to lauch these scripts from the Git Hub repository
I’m looking to collaborate on development teams to streamline the scripts.
You can reach me at kadri.ozyurt@ferguson.com.  I am also on Teams.
